# Project description:

A portable RPi-based motion detector and alarm system, to be placed in a cupboard or drawer in your house.
  If that drawer is opened by someone looking to steal your stuff, the motion / light detector registers this.
The device will flash for about 10 seconds - in this time you must disable the device before it alarms.
  The program is disabled through a pattern of input via the RPi SenseHat joystick.
If not disabled in time, the device will sound an audible alarm and display a warning message. 
  It will also send a notification to the owner that a heinous thief has invaded their snack drawer.
Designed for people who live with housemates they can't always keep an eye on.
  The device doesn't show you who the thief is, but given the timing of the theft, you will have clues to deduce who the diabolical deviant is. 
The noise may also raise an alarm in the house - innocent housemates drawn by the noise may spot the scoundrel for you.

# Tools, Technologies and Equipment

RPi v4 
SenseHAT - joystick and LED matrix
Motion sensor (or light sensor on SenseHAT, depending)
Power bank for mobile power

# Write a list of things you propose to use in your work. This can be hardware, programming languages etc.

Everything necessary on the software side to program this. 
Possibly Python for practice, as I'm more used to JS.
