# SnackTrap - IoT Networked Device Project

# Project description:

A portable RPi-based motion detector and alarm system, to be placed in a cupboard or drawer in your house.<br>
If that drawer is opened by someone looking to steal your stuff, the motion / light detector registers this. <br>
The device will flash for about 10 seconds - in this time you must disable the device before it alarms.<br>
The program is disabled through a pattern of input via the RPi SenseHat joystick.<br>
If not disabled in time, the device will sound an audible alarm and display a warning message. <br>
It will also send a notification (medium TBD) to the owner that a heinous thief has invaded their snack drawer.<br>
Designed for people who live with housemates they can't always keep an eye on.<br>
The device doesn't show you who the thief is, but given the timing of the theft, you will have clues to deduce who the diabolical deviant is. <br>
The noise may also raise an alarm in the house - innocent housemates drawn by the noise may spot the scoundrel for you.<br>

# Tools, Technologies and Equipment
<ul>
  <li> RPi v4
  <li> SenseHAT - joystick and LED matrix
  <li> Motion sensor (or light sensor on SenseHAT, depending)
  <li> Power bank for mobile power
</ul>
  
# Software, Programming languages
<ul>
  <li> Everything necessary on the software side to program this. 
  <li> Possibly Python for practice, as I'm more used to JS.
  <li> VSCode + SSH for headless RPi.
</ul>
